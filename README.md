# Description

These are some of the ModPE scripts that I created around 2013 using mostly JavaScript. These were made for Minecraft Pocket Edition (MCPE) and BlockLauncher, an app that lets you modify the game.

The link for the original forum post five years ago can be found [here](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-pocket-edition/mcpe-mods-tools/2175171-android-0-11-x-achievements-gui-statistics-gui).

Sadly, none of the screenshots in the original forum post no longer work and I lost access to my old Dropbox account where the screenshots are saved. The source code is provided here.

# Achievements and Statistics.js

Back then, Minecraft PE did not have achievements nor statistics unlike the Desktop/Java Edition. This mod uses data from the Desktop/Java version and recreates it into the mobile version using a custom-made GUI. This GUI uses Java and Android classes (e.g., Canvas, Paint, Matrix, etc.) and some Base64-encoded image and texture files.

# IngameMusic.js

Minecraft PE also did not have ingame music back then. This mod lets you enjoy background music, similar to the Desktop/Java version.

# Lib.js

This file was mostly for stuff behind-the-scenes like creating my own log files *for the player's commands and loading*.
